# Unidict 📖

**A universal, open-source, and AI-powered dictionary and language workbench.**

Unidict is not just another dictionary app. It's an ambitious project to build the ultimate tool for language learners, linguists, and knowledge workers. It combines the power of traditional offline dictionaries with modern AI assistance and a flexible, open architecture.

## ✨ Core Philosophy

Our development is guided by four key principles:

1.  **Performance is Paramount**: Dictionary lookups, especially in massive local files, must be instantaneous. The application is built with C++ and Qt to deliver native speed.
2.  **Truly Cross-Platform**: Unidict is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly across **Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS**, with a single, unified codebase.
3.  **Open and Extensible**: The project is open-source (MIT License). A powerful plugin system will allow the community to extend its capabilities, from supporting new dictionary formats to creating unique learning tools.
4.  **AI-Powered**: Unidict integrates modern Large Language Models (LLMs) to go beyond simple definitions, offering intelligent translation, grammar correction, contextual example sentences, and more.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Broad Dictionary Support**: Works with your existing dictionary files, including popular formats like **MDict (.mdx/.mdd)** and **StarDict**.
- **Powerful Search**: Offers everything from simple lookups to full-text, wildcard, and regex searches across all your dictionaries.
- **Integrated Learning Tools**: Features a built-in vocabulary book with an Anki-style spaced repetition system (SRS) to help you remember what you learn.
- **AI Assistant**: Provides smart translation, writing assistance, and contextual understanding that static dictionaries can't offer.
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Seamlessly syncs your vocabulary, notes, and settings across all your devices.
- **Terminal Mode**: Look up words directly from your command-line interface for maximum speed and efficiency.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core Logic**: C++
- **Framework**: Qt (for GUI, core utilities, and cross-platform abstraction)
- **UI**: QML (for a modern, declarative, and highly portable user interface)
- **Build System**: CMake
